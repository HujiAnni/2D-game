## How to Run

You can access this Project by clicking on this <a href="https://hujianni.github.io/Protect-the-Larva/" target="_blank">link</a>.
When the page is loaded, the game starts. Click within the frame to move your charater around. Push the eggs or the hatched larvas towards the bushes above and they're be safe (and you score 1 point)!
You can also push the unhatched eggs to the bushes before they are hatched to win the point.
Push away the enemies (those green toads) to protect the larva - or else you'll lost one, and if you lose 5 in total, you lost!

Score 10 to win, and press 'R' to restart the game whenever you want.
